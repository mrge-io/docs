The **`mg` CLI** lets you interact with [mrge.io](https://mrge.io) to manage stacked pull requests. Install it using Homebrew with the steps below.

<Note>
  **Prerequisites** - **Git** (v2.20+) - A **GitHub** account (optionally the
  GitHub CLI `gh` for authentication) - [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
</Note>

## Installation

Currently, the `mg` CLI is only supported through Homebrew:

```bash
brew install gh mrge-io/tap/mg
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
mg --version
```

<Tip>
  Homebrew works on macOS, Linux, and Windows (via WSL). If you don't have
  Homebrew installed, visit [brew.sh](https://brew.sh) for installation
  instructions.
