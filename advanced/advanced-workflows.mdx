# Advanced Workflows

For teams pushing the boundaries with multiple developers, monorepos, or partial merges, mrge accommodates more advanced patterns beyond the basics.

## Combining Partial Merges with Split Commits

- **Scenario**: You want to merge only a portion of a large branch into `main`, leaving other commits for later.
- **Solution**: Use [`mg split`](/reference/mg-split) to separate commits, then merge or cherry-pick the relevant subset. The unmerged portion remains stacked for further development.

## Rolling Back Merges in Mid-Stack

- If you merged `feature_1` but discovered an issue, you can roll back by:
  1. Reverting the merge in `main` via standard Git.
  2. Running [`mg sync`](/reference/mg-sync) so child branches rebase onto the reverted changes.
  3. If necessary, rename or re-parent child branches to reflect the new timeline.

## Handling Large Codebases and Monorepos

- **Subdirectory Splits**: Keep each sub-project in its own branch, stacked as needed.
- **Frequent Checks**: In a monorepo, changes can affect many modulesâ€”sync more often to avoid large conflicts.
- **Dedicated Trunk Branches**: Some teams keep separate mainlines for front-end and back-end code, then unify periodically.

## Recommended Git Configurations for Bigger Teams

- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automate linting or testing before commits. See [Integration Tips](/advanced/integration-tips).
- **Protected Branches**: Set your trunk branches to require PR approvals, ensuring that merges happen through mrge's stacked logic.
- **Commitlint**: If you enforce conventional commit messages, mrge works seamlessly with such a setup.
