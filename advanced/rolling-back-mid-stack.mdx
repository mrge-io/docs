# Rolling Back Merges in Mid-Stack

## Overview

Sometimes after merging a stacked branch, you may discover issues that require rolling back. This process is more complex with stacked branches since child branches depend on the merged changes.

## How it works

If you merged `feature_1` but discovered an issue, you can roll back by:

1. Reverting the merge in `main` via standard Git
2. Running [`mg sync`](/reference/mg-sync) so child branches rebase onto the reverted changes
3. If necessary, rename or re-parent child branches to reflect the new timeline

## Best practices

- Communicate with team members about the rollback to prevent confusion
- Consider creating a new branch for the fix rather than immediately re-merging the reverted branch
- Take additional time to test thoroughly before attempting to merge again

## Recovering after a rollback

After rolling back a merge, you have several options:

- Fix the issue in the original branch and re-merge
- Create a new branch with only the fixed portion of the feature
- Completely redesign the approach if the issue requires a fundamental change
