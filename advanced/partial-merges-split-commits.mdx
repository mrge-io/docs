# Partial Merges with Split Commits

## Overview

When working with large features, you may want to merge only a portion of your branch into the main trunk while continuing development on the remaining changes.

## How it works

- **Scenario**: You want to merge only a portion of a large branch into `main`, leaving other commits for later.
- **Solution**: Use [`mg split`](/reference/mg-split) to separate commits, then merge or cherry-pick the relevant subset. The unmerged portion remains stacked for further development.

## Step-by-step process

1. Use `mg split` to separate your branch into smaller, logically distinct parts
2. Merge the ready portion into main while continuing work on the remaining changes
3. The unmerged portion remains stacked, allowing you to continue development

## Benefits

- Enables incremental delivery of features
- Reduces the size and complexity of individual merges
- Allows you to get feedback on portions of your work while continuing development
