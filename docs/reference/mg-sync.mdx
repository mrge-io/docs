description: 'Sync your stack with the remote trunk'

## Name

`mg sync` â€” Rebase or merge local branches against the latest commits from the trunk branch (e.g., `main`).

## Synopsis

```bash
mg sync [--rebase-only] [--merge]
```

## Description

- Fetches remote updates, applies them to your current branch and all its children.
- By default, uses a rebase strategy to keep your commit history linear.

## Options / Flags

- **`--rebase-only`**: Force rebase, even if your config says otherwise.
- **`--merge`**: Use a merge strategy instead of rebase.

## Examples

```bash
# Basic sync with default rebase approach
mg sync

# Force a merge approach
mg sync --merge
```

<Note>
  - Conflict resolution is interactive; you must resolve conflicts before the
  sync proceeds. - If your trunk has changed drastically, consider syncing more
  frequently.
