# mg next

## Name

`mg next` â€” Switch to the "next" child branch in your current stack.

## Synopsis

```bash
mg next
```

## Description

- If you're on `feature_1`, and the next branch is `feature_2`, it checks out `feature_2`.
- If there is no next branch, it indicates you're at the top of your stack.

## Examples

```bash
# Move from feature_1 to feature_2
mg next
```

<Note>
  - "Next" is determined by the stacked order in `mg list`.
  - If your branch structure is non-linear or has multiple children, mg prompts you to choose which "next" to move to.
