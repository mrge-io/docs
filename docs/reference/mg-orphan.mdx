## Name

`mg orphan` â€” Remove a branch from mrge's stack management.

## Synopsis

```bash
mg orphan <branch_name>
```

## Description

- Disassociates `<branch_name>` from your mrge stack (does not delete the branch from Git).
- Child branches remain but will still point to the old parent unless reparented or orphaned as well.

## Examples

```bash
# Orphan the branch "feature_2" from the stack
mg orphan feature_2
```

<Note>
  - This is **irreversible** in mrge's metadata; to bring it back, use [mg adopt](/docs/reference/mg-adopt).
  - Orphaned branches won't appear in `mg list`.
</Note>
