**mrge** is a developer-focused platform that simplifies **stacked pull requests**. It provides a lightweight CLI, **`mg`**, to help you split your work into smaller, review-friendly branches—without fighting manual rebases or complicated merges.

---

## Why stacked pull requests?

- **Smaller, easier reviews** – Instead of one massive PR, break features into smaller, dependent branches.
- **Faster iteration** – You can start the next piece of work immediately, even if earlier PRs aren't merged yet.
- **Less merge pain** – Each PR focuses on a single change, so merges and conflicts are simpler to handle.

---

## Why mrge?

- **Straightforward commands** – Create and push new branches with ease.
- **Automatic restacking** – Let `mg` handle rebase cascades when trunk changes.
- **Visual clarity** – Inspect your entire branch hierarchy with one command.
- **Git-friendly** – Keep using GitHub or your usual hosting; mrge just layers on top.
