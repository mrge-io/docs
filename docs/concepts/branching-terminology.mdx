description: "Key Git and mrge terms for stacked development"
---

When working with **stacked pull requests**, you'll encounter specific terms and conceptsâ€”both from Git and from mrge. Use this page as a quick reference for branch-related jargon.

<Info>
  Understanding these terms will help you navigate the stacked workflow more
  effectively and communicate better with your team.

## Parent branch

A **parent branch** is the branch that your current branch is based on.

- In a stacked workflow, `feature_2` might have `feature_1` as its parent.
- Once `feature_1` merges, `feature_2` typically rebases onto the updated `main` (if needed).

## Child branch

A **child branch** is a branch whose parent is another active branch in the stack.

- For example, if `feature_2` depends on commits in `feature_1`, then `feature_2` is considered a child of `feature_1`.
- You can see these relationships by running [`mg list`](/docs/reference/mg-list)

## Orphan branch

In mrge, an **orphan branch** is any branch that has been removed from the tracked stack. This can happen if you decide a branch is no longer relevant.

<Warning>
  When you orphan a branch, its children (if any) will need a new parent or
  might also become orphaned.
</Warning>

- You can orphan a branch with [`mg orphan`](/docs/reference/mg-orphan).
- Once orphaned, its children (if any) will need a new parent or might also be orphaned.

## Sync

**Sync** refers to the process of updating your local branch (and its children) with the latest changes from the remote parent branch (often `main`).

<Tip>
  Regular syncing helps prevent merge conflicts from becoming too complex and
  keeps your branches current with the main codebase.
</Tip>

- Typically done via [`mg sync`](/docs/reference/mg-sync).
- Sync can rebase or merge your branches, ensuring they stay current with teammates' commits.

## Upstream & downstream

These are general Git terms:

- **Upstream**: The remote branch or parent branch that your local branch tracks. In mrge's stacked model, `main` might be upstream for the root of your stack.
- **Downstream**: Branches that rely on your current branch or follow it in the commit chain. Child branches are downstream from their parent.

## Where to see these concepts in action

- **[Create a stacked PR](/docs/how-to-guides/create-stacked-prs)**: Demonstrates parent-child relationships when stacking multiple features.
- **[Handle updates & sync](/docs/how-to-guides/handle-updates-sync)**: Learn how to keep branches in sync with the latest changes in `main`.
- **[Adopt or orphan a branch](/docs/how-to-guides/adopt-or-orphan-branch)**: Manage how branches enter or leave mrge's tracking system.
