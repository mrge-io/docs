This page addresses frequently asked questions and common obstacles you might encounter when using **mrge**. If you don't find your issue here, check our [community forums](https://community.mrge.io) or open a GitHub issue.

## Why is my branch out of sync?

- **Symptoms**:
  - You see a message like "This branch is X commits behind `main`."
  - Merge conflicts pop up unexpectedly when creating or pushing a PR.
- **Cause**: Your local branch might be outdated compared to `main` or your parent branch.
- **Solution**:
  1. Pull the latest changes from remote:
     ```bash
     git fetch origin main
     ```
  2. Run [`mg sync`](/docs/reference/mg-sync) to rebase or merge your current branch onto the latest commits.

## I can't push my stack â€“ conflict with remote?

- **Symptoms**:
  - `mg push` fails with a conflict error message.
  - GitHub shows a "resolve conflicts" prompt.
- **Cause**: One of your parent branches was rebased or force-pushed, and your local changes no longer match.
- **Solution**:
  1. Run `git fetch origin` to ensure you have the latest changes.
  2. Resolve conflicts locally, then commit.
  3. Retry `mg push`.  
     If the problem persists, confirm nobody has force-pushed `main`.

## Error codes or known tricky scenarios

- **`E-101: No .mrge directory found`**
  - Ensure you've run [`mg init`](/docs/reference/mg-init) in your repo.
- **`E-202: Branch not tracked`**
  - Adopt the branch with [`mg adopt <branch_name>`](/docs/reference/mg-adopt) or recreate it using [`mg create`](/docs/reference/mg-create).
- **`E-303: Force push required`**
  - This appears if you rewrite commits on a published branch. You can force push, but coordinate with teammates to avoid confusion.
- **`E-404: Branch does not exist`**
  - Verify the branch name and ensure it's spelled correctly.
- **`E-409: Merge conflict`**
  - Resolve conflicts, `git add` the files, then continue your `mg sync` or `mg push` workflow.

## General tips

- **Keep Branches Small**: Smaller changes reduce merge conflicts and simplify troubleshooting.
- **Sync Frequently**: If you're constantly out of date, [handle updates & sync](/docs/how-to-guides/handle-updates-sync) more often.
- **Check `mg list`**: If a branch is missing or incorrectly parented, reparent or adopt as needed.
