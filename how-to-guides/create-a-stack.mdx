title: 'Create a stack'
description: 'Build multiple pull requests on top of each other with mg.'

Stacks allow you to break a big feature into multiple dependent branches, each with its own PR. This approach makes it easier to review smaller, self-contained changes instead of dealing with one massive pull request.

<Note>

**Prerequisites**

- A repo already [initialized with `mg init`](/how-to-guides/initialize-in-repo).
- Basic familiarity with key mg commands like `mg create` and `mg push`.

</Note>

---

## 1. Start from your trunk

Begin by checking out your trunk branch (often `main` or `master`):

```bash
mg checkout main
```

---

## 2. First branch

Make your first set of changes:

```bash
echo "console.log('Part A')" > partA.js
mg add partA.js
mg create -m "feat: part A"
```

You can open a pull request immediately by pushing:

```bash
mg push
```

<Tip>
  When you push, `mg` will prompt you to update the PR title and description if
  needed.
</Tip>

---

## 3. Second branch on top

Let's build on that first branch:

```bash
echo "console.log('Part B')" > partB.js
mg add partB.js
mg create -m "feat: part B"
```

Now, if you run:

```bash
mg list
```

You'll see a short tree:

```
main
 └─ feat_part_A
    └─ feat_part_B
```

Each of these branches can become its own PR.

---

## 4. Push & review your branches

```bash
mg push --all
```

This command updates (or creates) your pull requests on Mrge (and GitHub). Each branch is a smaller PR, but together, they form one cohesive feature. Your team can review them in sequence or parallel, merging them once approved.

<Tip>
  If you prefer pushing branches one at a time, that's fine, too. Just call `mg
  push` while on each branch.
</Tip>

---

## 5. Keep moving

- **Check out the next branch in the stack**: `mg next`
- **Check out the previous branch in the stack**: `mg prev`
- **Visualize again**: `mg list`

Add as many branches as you need for each logical slice of your feature.

---

### Best Practices

- **One logical change per branch**: Keep each branch focused on a single feature or sub-feature.
- **Name branches descriptively**: It's easier to see what each PR does when reading the branch list.
- **Push frequently**: Ensures your teammates can see your ongoing work and provide feedback early.

---

### Next steps

- **[Keep your stack updated](/how-to-guides/keep-your-stack-updated)**: Sync from `main` if teammates add new commits.
- **[Merge your stack in Mrge](/how-to-guides/merge-your-stack)**: Once each PR is ready, merge them in the right order via the Mrge UI.

  That's it! You've built a multi-branch, multi-PR stack that's simpler for your
  team to review and merge. Happy stacking!
