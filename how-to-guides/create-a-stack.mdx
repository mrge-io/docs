# Create a stack

Stacks allow you to break a big feature into multiple dependent branches, each with its own PR. Reviewers can check small diffs instead of one massive change.

> **Prerequisites**
>
> - Repo initialized with `mg init`
> - Familiarity with basic mg commands (`mg create`, `mg push`, etc.)

---

## 1. Start from your trunk

```bash
mg checkout main
```

or:

```bash
mg checkout master
```

---

## 2. First branch

```bash
echo "console.log('Part A')" > partA.js
mg add partA.js
mg create -m "feat: part A"
```

Push if you want to open a PR right away:

```bash
mg push
```

---

## 3. Second branch on top

```bash
echo "console.log('Part B')" > partB.js
mg add partB.js
mg create -m "feat: part B"
```

Now `mg list` might show:

```
main
 └─ feat_part_A
    └─ feat_part_B
```

---

## 4. Push & review each PR

```bash
mg push --all
```

This creates/updates two PRs on mrge.io (and GitHub). Each branch is smaller, but collectively they form one bigger feature.

---

## 5. Keep navigating

- **Move up**: `mg next`
- **Move down**: `mg prev`
- **Re-check** the tree: `mg list`

You can keep stacking as many branches as you need.

---

### Next steps

- **Sync** changes from `main` or fix mid-stack branches with [Keep your stack updated](/how-to-guides/keep-your-stack-updated).
- **Merge** your entire stack in the [mrge UI](/how-to-guides/merge-your-stack) once everything's approved.

That's it! You've built a multi-branch, multi-PR stack that's simpler for your team to review.
