description: "Set up mg in your local repo to start using stacked PRs."

Learn how to configure **`mg`** so it knows your trunk branch and can manage stacked PRs.

> **Why initialize?**  
> `mg init` sets your trunk (often `main`), ensuring mg knows where to base new branches and how to restack them.

---

## Steps

1. **Navigate to Your Repo**

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your-project
   ```

2. **Run `mg init`**

   ```bash
   mg init
   ```

   - Prompts you to select `main` or `master` (or another trunk branch).
   - Creates a `.git/mrge_repo_config` file for storing config.

3. **Confirm It Worked**

   ```bash
   mg list
   ```

   - If your repo already has branches, you'll see them listed.
   - If it's a fresh repo, you'll see only `main`.

> **Authentication**  
> If mg needs to push to GitHub and can't detect credentials, it may ask you to authenticate via `gh` or a personal access token.

## Next steps

- Try the [Quickstart](/quickstart) for a hands-on example of creating and pushing stacked branches.
- Or see [Create a Pull Request](/how-to-guides/create-a-pull-request) for a single-branch workflow.

That's it! You've initialized **mrge** in your local repository.
