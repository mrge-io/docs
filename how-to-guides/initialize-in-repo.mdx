title: "Initialize mrge"
description: "Set up mg in your local repo to start using stacked PRs."
---

Learn how to configure **`mg`** so it knows your trunk branch and can manage stacked PRs.

<Info>
  **Why initialize?** 
  
  `mg init` sets your trunk (often `main`), ensuring mg
  knows where to base new branches and how to restack them.

## Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Your Repo">
    ```bash 
    cd /path/to/your-project 
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run mg init">
    ```bash 
    mg init 
    ``` 
    
    This will: 
    - Prompt you to select `main` or `master` (or another trunk branch) 
    - Create a `.git/mrge_repo_config` file for storing config
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm It Worked">
    ```bash 
    mg list 
    ``` 
    
    - If your repo already has branches, you'll see them listed 
    - If it's a fresh repo, you'll see only `main`
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  **Authentication** If mg needs to push to GitHub and can't detect credentials,
  it may ask you to authenticate via `gh` or a personal access token.
</Note>

## Next steps

- Try the [Quickstart](/quickstart) for a hands-on example of creating and pushing stacked branches.
- Or see [Create a Pull Request](/how-to-guides/create-a-pull-request) for a single-branch workflow.

That's it! You've initialized **mrge** in your local repository.
