# Create a pull request

If you're only opening **one** pull request—no complex stacking—**you can keep using normal Git commands** exactly as before (e.g., `git checkout -b my-feature`, `git commit -m "message"`, `git push`). Using **mg** is entirely optional for a single PR workflow—but it can still help you **save time** with commands like `mg create` and `mg push`.

> **Prerequisites**
>
> - [Install mg](/installation) (optional for single PRs, but useful if you want to try mg's features)
> - [Initialize your repo](/how-to-guides/initialize-in-repo) if you plan on using mg for pushing to mrge/GitHub

## 1. Make your changes (Option A: Use mg)

If you want to see how mg can simplify a typical Git flow, you can do:

```bash
# Create + commit in one command:
echo "console.log('Single PR')" > single.js
mg add single.js
mg create -m "feat: add single PR example"
```

This automatically creates a new branch and commits changes under that branch.

### Or (Option B: Keep using Git)

```bash
git checkout -b single-pr-example
echo "console.log('Single PR')" > single.js
git add single.js
git commit -m "feat: add single PR example"
```

Both approaches are valid. In either case, your new branch is ready for a pull request.

---

## 2. Push to open a PR

- **If using mg**:

  ```bash
  mg push
  ```

  mg might open your editor (vim, nano, etc.) so you can edit the PR title/description. It then prints a link to the PR on mrge.io or GitHub.

- **If using Git**:
  ```bash
  git push -u origin single-pr-example
  ```
  Then open GitHub or [mrge.io](https://mrge.io) in your browser to create the PR manually.

Either way, you end up with a single PR on GitHub or mrge.

## 3. Respond to reviews

If your teammates review the PR and request changes:

1. Check out your feature branch if needed (using Git or mg):
   ```bash
   mg checkout single-pr-example
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   git checkout single-pr-example
   ```
2. Make changes, commit them (Git or mg):
   ```bash
   git commit -am "Fix: addressed feedback"
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   mg add .
   mg commit -m "Fix: addressed feedback"
   ```
3. **Push** again:
   ```bash
   mg push
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   git push
   ```
   The existing PR automatically updates.

---

## 4. Merge

You can merge your single-PR branch through **GitHub**'s UI or the **[mrge UI](/how-to-guides/merge-your-stack)** (mrge can show just one PR, even if it's not a stack). Either way, once it's approved and merged, you're done!

---

## That's it!

For a single pull request, your workflow doesn't really change—you can continue using Git exactly as before. **mg** is there if you'd like to streamline creating branches and pushing PRs, but it's optional for one-branch flows.
