description: "Use the mrge UI to merge stacked PRs in the correct order."
---

Once your stacked PRs are approved, **mrge** offers a clean UI ([mrge.io](https://mrge.io)) for merging them in the right order—no guessing or manual rebasing.

> **Tip**: You can also merge via GitHub, but the mrge UI provides a stacked view to help you see dependencies at a glance.

---

## 1. Open your repository on mrge

1. **Sign in** at [mrge.io](https://mrge.io).
2. Navigate to your repository.
3. **Select** the stack you want to merge.

---

## 2. Review branches

- Click on each branch in the UI to see diffs and comments.
- If needed, go back locally, edit, and push changes. (See [Keep your stack updated](/how-to-guides/keep-your-stack-updated).)

---

## 3. Merge in sequence

1. Click **Merge** on the lowest branch in the stack (the parent).
2. mrge merges it and re-stacks child branches automatically.
3. Continue merging up the stack until all branches are done.

> **Partial merges**: If you only want to land the first few branches, that's fine—mrge restacks the remaining branches on top of the newly updated trunk.

---

## 4. Check locally

After merges:

```bash
mg sync
```

This ensures your local stack is up-to-date and merges are reflected. Merged branches disappear from `mg list` (unless they still have children that aren't merged yet).

---

## Done!

Your stacked PRs are successfully merged. Time to celebrate—or start another stack!

- **Got new features?** Rinse and repeat with `mg create`.

**Thanks for using mrge!**
