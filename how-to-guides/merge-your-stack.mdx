title: 'Merge your stack'
description: 'Use the cubic UI to merge stacked PRs in the correct order.'
---

Once your stacked pull requests are approved, **cubic** offers a dedicated UI ([cubic.io](https://cubic.io)) for merging them in the **correct order**—no guesswork or manual rebasing required. Each dependent branch is merged in sequence, preventing conflicts and ensuring a clean commit history.

<Note>
  You *can* merge in GitHub's interface if you prefer. However, the **cubic** UI
  displays an at-a-glance view of your stack, making it easy to see
  dependencies, merge partially, or skip certain branches if needed.
</Note>

## Why merge in cubic?

- **Automatic Ordering**: Child branches can't merge until their parent is merged, so you never accidentally merge a downstream branch first.

- **Clear Visibility**: See which branches are ready to merge and which are still awaiting review or CI checks.

- **Partial Merges**: Land just the bottom few branches if needed, and cubic will restack the remaining branches on top of the newly updated trunk.

## 1. Open your repository in cubic

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign in">
    Go to [cubic.io](https://cubic.io) and sign in with your GitHub account.
  </Step>

<Step title="Locate your repo">
  From your dashboard, select the repository that contains your stacked PRs.
</Step>

  <Step title="Choose your stack">
    cubic automatically detects your open PRs and displays them in a stack view.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 2. Review branches

Before merging, you might want to:

- **Check diffs**: Click each branch to see its changes, commits, and any review comments.

- **Update the code**: If there's feedback or a last-minute fix, go back to your local setup, edit, and push changes ([Keep your stack updated](/how-to-guides/keep-your-stack-updated)). cubic will reflect those updates automatically.

---

## 3. Merge in sequence

<Steps>
  <Step title="Merge the bottom branch">
    Click **Merge** on the lowest branch in the stack (the "parent"). cubic
    merges it and updates the trunk automatically.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Continue up the stack">
    Move to the next branch that depends on the one you just merged, and click
    **Merge** again. Repeat until you reach the top.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  **Partial merges**: If you only want to merge the first few branches for now,
  that's totally fine—cubic restacks the remaining branches on top of the new
  trunk.
</Info>

## 4. Sync locally

Once you've merged some or all of your branches, update your local environment:

```bash
mg sync
```

This ensures your local stack is up-to-date and merges are reflected. Merged branches disappear from `mg list` (unless they still have children that aren't merged yet).

---

## Done!

Your stacked PRs are successfully merged. Time to celebrate—or start another stack!

- **Got new features?** Rinse and repeat with `mg branch` or `mg branch -t` to automatically create the new branch from trunk.

**Thanks for using cubic!**
