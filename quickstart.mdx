description: "Create your first stacked PR."
---

This guide shows how to **create your first two stacked pull requests** on [mrge.io](https://mrge.io) (or GitHub).  
In about **5 minutes**, you'll have:

- A trunk branch (`main`)
- Two feature branches stacked on top
- Each branch opened as a PR in [mrge.io](https://mrge.io) (and GitHub)

---

## Quick installation

For macOS users:

```bash
brew install mrge-org/tap/mg
```

<Note>
  If you're not on macOS or need more detailed installation steps, check the
  [Full Installation Guide](/installation).
</Note>

---

## 1) Initialize & setup

```bash
cd /path/to/your-repo
mg init
```

<Info>
  This will **identify your trunk branch** (usually `main` or `master`) so mg
  knows where to base new branches.
</Info>

<Tip>
  **Authentication tip:** If you haven't authenticated with GitHub, mg may ask
  for a personal access token or use the GitHub CLI (`gh`).
</Tip>

## 2) Building your first stack

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check our main/master">
    Make sure you're on the trunk branch:

    ```bash
    mg checkout main
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create the first feature branch">

    ```bash
    mg create feature_1
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="View your stack">

    ```bash
    mg list
    ```

    You should see:

    ```
    main
    └─ feature_1
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Write code & commit">

    ```bash
    mg add . && mg commit -m "My commit message"
    ```

    (Or just use normal Git commands—`mg` passes unrecognized subcommands to `git`.)

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a second branch">

    ```bash
    mg create feature_2
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Commit more changes">

    ```bash
    mg add . && mg commit -m "Another commit"
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="View your stack again">

    ```bash
    mg list
    ```

    It now shows:

    ```
    main
    └─ feature_1
        └─ feature_2
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Sync if trunk changes">
    If teammates have pushed code to `main`, run:

    ```bash
    mg sync
    ```

    This fetches changes and automatically **re-stacks** your branches on top of the updated trunk. It won't force-pull your local, so you may still do a normal `git pull` if needed.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Push your stack">

    ```bash
    mg push
    ```

    By default, this opens an editor prompt where you can tweak the PR title/description.

    - Tip: `mg push --all` pushes **every** branch in your local stack at once.
    - If you try `mg push` from a child branch before pushing its parent, mg may fail to create the PR (because the parent PR isn't on remote yet).

  </Step>
  <Step title="Check your PRs">

    ```bash
    mg list
    ```

    Now each branch has an associated PR on [mrge.io](https://mrge.io) or GitHub. You can open the UI to see them stacked.

  </Step>
</Steps>

**Done!** That's the typical day-to-day flow for building stacked features.

## 3) Common Commands

Here are the most essential commands to get you started:

<Note>
  `mg` only intercepts recognized subcommands. Everything else is passed through
  to Git, so your normal Git workflow stays intact.
</Note>

- **`mg create <branch_name>`** - Create a new branch on top of the one you're on
- **`mg list`** - View your entire stack/tree of branches
- **`mg checkout <branch>`** - Switch to a different branch
- **`mg push`** - Push the current branch (PR) to remote
- **`mg push --all`** - Push the entire stack to remote
- **`mg sync`** - Sync with remote (rebases and re-stacks if `main` changed)
- **`mg next`** / **`mg prev`** - Move up or down in the stack

<Tip>

  Command Cheatsheet](/reference/command-cheatsheet).
