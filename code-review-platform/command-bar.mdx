The command bar is your keyboard‑first control center for **mrge**. Press `⌘ K` from anywhere and you can find a pull request, trigger a review action, or jump between views—without lifting your hands off the keyboard.

## Why use the command bar?

- **Stay in flow.** Keep typing instead of hunting for buttons.
- **One shortcut, many powers.** Search, navigate, and execute—all in the same overlay.
- **Consistent everywhere.** Whether you’re on the Dashboard, inside a PR, or in the Desktop app, `⌘ K` works the same.

## Opening the bar

```text
macOS   ⌘ K
Windows Ctrl K
```

## Search anything

1. **Pull requests** – type part of the title, branch name, or `#` number.
2. **Authors** – prefix with `author:` or simply start typing a teammate’s @handle.
3. **Pages and actions – jump straight to "AI review settings", "Invite team", or any other configuration screen.**

Results update as you type. Use `↑ / ↓` to highlight, `↵` to open.

## Common PR actions

- Approve pull request
- Request changes
- Copy link
- Assign reviewer

Actions run instantly—so you can blast through a queue.

## Keyboard navigation inside the bar

- `↑ / ↓` – Move selection
- `↵` – Execute / open
- `Esc` – Close bar
- `→` – Toggle between **Navigate** and **Actions**
