title: 'Intelligent PR review experience'

mrge offers a powerful yet familiar interface for reviewing pull requests, enhanced with intelligent features to simplify the code review process.

## Intelligent file ordering

mrge automatically arranges and groups changed files to streamline your review process.

Files are organized logically, grouping related changes to help you understand the PR more quickly and easily.

## Group summaries

When the AI detects complexity or connections between multiple file changes, mrge generates concise summaries to provide quick context.

These summaries might include helpful visual diagrams showing how changes interact with other parts of your code.

## AI sidebar assistant

mrge includes a helpful AI assistant integrated into the sidebar. You can easily ask questions about specific parts of the code without leaving the review.

To use this feature:

- Click the sidebar icon to open the AI assistant.
- Highlight the code you're unsure about, then press Cmd + L (or Ctrl + L on Windows), or click the chat button to paste the code directly into the assistant.

The AI assistant can help clarify code functionality, suggest best practices, or point out potential issues. If it suggests a comment you like, you can quickly apply it to the PR and edit it if needed.

This integrated approach makes interacting with AI simple, eliminating the need to copy and paste into separate tools.

## Automated PR descriptions

When a new PR is created, mrge automatically writes a clear summary of the changes and adds it to the PR description. You can still edit or adjust this description yourself.

If you're editing, you can also ask mrge’s AI to improve or rewrite the PR description by clicking the Write or Improve Pull Request with AI button.

Additionally, mrge can help you write or refine your PR title with AI assistance. Note that this feature isn’t automatic—you’ll need to manually request it.
