## Auto-generate PR descriptions

AI-generated PR descriptions summarize changes clearly, helping reviewers quickly understand the context and impact of your pull requests.

By default, mrge generates PR descriptions automatically whenever a new pull request is opened, provided that the setting is enabled for your repository.

To enable or disable auto-generated descriptions:

1. Navigate to the AI review settings for your repository
2. Toggle **AI-generated PR descriptions** on or off

## Manual generation

You can manually trigger AI-generated descriptions at any time:

- Click the **AI button** located in the PR description editor

When manually triggering a description:

- If existing text is present, mrge considers this context and enhances it
- If the description field is empty, mrge creates a comprehensive summary from scratch

## Best practices

To get the most out of AI PR descriptions:

- Include brief context or bullet points before triggering manual generation
- Clearly mention acceptance criteria or key points you'd like highlighted

This ensures AI-generated content is precisely tailored to your team's needs.
