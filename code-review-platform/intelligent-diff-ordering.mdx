title: 'Intelligent file ordering'
---

mrge's intelligent file ordering feature automatically organizes files in pull requests into logical groups based on the context of the changes. Instead of traditional alphabetical ordering, files are clustered by their semantic relevance, helping you review faster and with greater clarity.

## Why it matters

- **Logical review flow** – Files that relate to the same feature or fix appear together, eliminating context switching.
- **Faster understanding** – By grouping related changes, mrge helps you quickly grasp the scope and purpose of the edits.
- **Improved review accuracy** – Reduces the likelihood of missing important changes scattered across multiple files.

## How groups are determined

mrge analyzes each pull request, considering:

- **Semantic relationships** – Functions, components, or logic that interact closely with each other.
- **File proximity** – Changes within related files or directories are grouped naturally.
- **Commit history** – Groups files modified together historically, recognizing patterns in how your team works.

## Customizing your view

You can easily toggle between intelligent ordering and traditional alphabetical sorting directly in the pull request view, giving you flexibility based on your preference or the nature of the review.
