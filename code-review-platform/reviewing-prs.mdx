## Layout

When you open a pull request, you'll first see the PR overview, which includes the description, AI review statuses, reviewers, and other key information. Below this overview, you'll find two main tabs:

- **Discussion tab:** View and participate in discussions, comments, and general feedback.
- **Changes tab:** See code diffs, navigate file changes, and leave inline comments.

Within the Changes tab, you'll see two main areas:

- **Intelligently ordered files (left):** Easily navigate between files and versions. Click on a file to view its changes.
- **Actual diffs (right):** View the detailed code differences and inline comments.

## Navigating diffs

Quickly move through diffs to speed up your review:

- **Toggle tabs:** `C` (changes tab) / `D` (discussion tab).
- **Scroll:** `J` (down) / `K` (up).
- **Navigate comments:** `Option + ↑` (previous comment) / `Option + ↓` (next comment).
- **Toggle diff view:** `Cmd + Shift + U` (unified) / `Cmd + Shift + S` (split).

## File versions

A *version* snapshot is created on **every push** to the PR branch. Switching versions lets you see **exactly what changed since you last viewed the PR**, rather than the full diff against `main`.

/>

- **Pick a version:** In the file‑tree header, open the **Version dropdown** and choose the commit snapshot you want to compare.
- **Review incrementally:** Select *Previous version → Latest* to review only the new changes pushed after your last visit.
- **Debug regressions:** Jump back to the first version to understand how the PR evolved over time.
- **Spot outdated comments:** Any comment left on a line that changed in a newer version is automatically flagged with an **Outdated** tag, keeping discussions focused on the latest code.

> **Tip:** Versions respect all the same navigation shortcuts, so you can keep your hands on the keyboard while reviewing incremental updates.

## Leaving comments

Comments help guide authors to refine code before merging. mrge supports two types of comments:

- **Inline comments:** Click on a specific line number to leave a line‑level comment.
- **General file comments:** Leave overall comments about the file at the bottom of the diff view.

mrge supports Markdown formatting for rich and readable feedback. Include code snippets clearly by using triple backticks:

````markdown
```javascript
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```
````

You can also click the **GIF** button—or press `Cmd + Shift + G`—to browse our GIF library and drop an animated image straight into your comment or review—perfect for celebratory approvals or quick visual cues.

### Suggestions in one click

If you prefix the fenced block with the word `suggestion`, mrge transforms it into an **apply‑in‑one‑click patch**:

````markdown
```suggestion
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```
````

Reviewers can then click **Apply suggestion** and commit the change instantly.

### AI‑generated suggestions

Not sure of the exact code? Click the **Generate suggestion** button next to the comment field (or hit `Cmd + Enter` after typing your comment). mrge sends the surrounding context to the AI and inserts a ready‑to‑apply patch inside your comment draft—edit as needed, then hit **Submit**.

## Submitting your review

mrge lets you submit your review clearly and quickly. At the top right of the PR page, use the buttons:

- **Approve:** Mark the PR as ready to merge. Shortcut: `Shift + A`.
- **Request changes:** Indicate that further work is needed. Shortcut: `Shift + R`.
- **Comment:** Leave neutral feedback or ask questions. Shortcut: `Shift + C`.

Your comments automatically save as drafts. When ready, click **Submit review** to publish.
