title: 'AI change visualizations'

AI change visualizations work **hand-in-hand with intelligent file ordering**. When mrge clusters related files into a logical change-set, it decides—on a per-group basis—whether an AI summary and visual diff will meaningfully speed up the review. 

If the edits are straightforward, the group is shown without extra visuals to keep the page light; if the changes are dense or spread across several files, mrge adds the visualization automatically.

## Why it matters

- **Instant context for dense diffs**: Large, refactor-heavy groups get an at-a-glance explanation so you know what changed before diving in.
- **Less cognitive load**: You review only the groups that truly need extra guidance; simple tweaks aren't over-explained.
- **Fewer missed side-effects**: The AI summary calls out secondary impacts (e.g., API signature updates) that might hide in a plain diff.

## Grouped change cards

Each change group displays a compact card directly above its first file:

- **AI summary**: One or two sentences that explain the intent of the edits. This is shown whenever mrge believes written context will accelerate the review.
- **Visual diff** *(optional)*: A side-by-side snippet or small diagram that highlights the most significant before/after. The diagram only appears if it adds clarity; simpler groups may show the summary alone.

## When visualizations appear

mrge doesn't rely on hard line-count rules. Instead, it asks a simpler question for every group: **"Would an extra explanation or diagram materially help the reviewer?"**

- If **yes**, you'll see a summary, and—when visual context matters—a visual diff as well.
- If **no**, the group renders as a standard diff to keep noise low.

Because the decision is heuristic, you might see a summary-only card in one group, a full summary + diagram in another, and no card at all for straightforward tweaks.
