## Why integrate with Slack?

Slack integration helps your team stay on top of PR reviews, comments, and merges by delivering updates where your team already collaborates. It eliminates the need to switch contexts, ensuring faster PR turnaround and better collaboration.

## Connecting Slack

1. **Navigate to Settings**\
   Open your user settings by clicking your profile icon in the top-right corner and selecting **Settings**.

2. **Connect Slack**\
   In the **Notifications** section, click on **Connect Slack**. This will redirect you to Slack's authorization page.

3. **Authorize Slack**\
   Select your Slack workspace and click **Authorize** to connect mrge to Slack.

## Types of Notifications

mrge can send Slack notifications for:

- **Review Requests**: Instantly notified when someone requests your review.
- **New Comments**: Updates when new comments are posted on your PRs.
- **PR Approved**: Get notified when one of your PRs gets approved.
- **PR Merged**: Notifications when PRs you are involved with are merged.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Will I get notifications for PRs created before I installed the Slack integration?**

Yes, once you've authorised the Slack integration, you'll start receiving notifications for updates to all PRs, including those that were created before the app was installed. So you won't miss anything, even on older PRs.

**Who receives notifications for a PR?**

Anyone listed as a "reviewer" on the PR will get notified for all three types: review requests, new comments, and merges. Additionally, anyone following the PR (for example, if you've commented on the PR or merged code into it) will also receive these notifications.

**Can I customize the notifications I receive?**

Currently, you can't fine-tune which notifications you get. However, more granular controls (org-wide or per-user) are on our roadmap, as we understand this would be super helpful.

## Disconnecting Slack

To disconnect Slack from mrge:

- Visit your **Settings → Notifications → Slack**.
- Click **Disconnect**

Once disconnected, you will stop receiving mrge notifications in Slack.
