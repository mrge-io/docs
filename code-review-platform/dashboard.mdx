The **Pull request dashboard** acts similarly to an email inbox, providing a clear overview of all PRs requiring your attention.

## Selected repositories

You can select the repositories you want to review in the **Pull request dashboard** by clicking the **Select repositories** button.

## Inbox sections

cubic provides six standard sections in your inbox:

- **Needs your review**: PRs awaiting your review or approval.
- **Approved**: PRs you've approved, pending further action.
- **Returned to you**: PRs requiring additional changes or action from you.
- **Waiting for others**: PRs that require review or changes from others
- **Drafts**: PRs in draft status.
- **Recently merged**: PRs currently merging or recently merged.

## Searching pull requests

Quickly search for specific PRs across all synchronized repositories using fuzzy search capabilities that include:

- PR title
- PR description
- Author details

Access the search function via the search icon in the top right corner or by using the keyboard shortcut **Cmd + K** (Mac) or **Ctrl + K** (Windows).
