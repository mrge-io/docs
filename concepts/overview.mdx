cubic is built on the principle that **small, incremental changes** are easier to review, test, and merge than massive commits.

In a world where **AI tools** can generate large amounts of code quickly, keeping changes small and well-organized is **even more critical** for human reviewers.

By stacking pull requests, you can develop feature after feature without merging each one back into `main` first, while ensuring every increment is clear, reviewable, and testable.

## What are stacked PRs?

A "stacked PR" is simply a pull request that is **based on another in-progress pull request**, instead of being branched off your main code branch. Conceptually, imagine each branch in your workflow as a short step on top of the previous one:

```
main
└── feature_1
    └── feature_2
        └── feature_3
```

Each feature branch builds on the work of the previous one. This makes it easier to:

- **Keep pull requests small**: Each PR includes only the delta from its parent.

- **Allow early feedback**: Teammates can review `feature_2` independently of `feature_1`.

- **Reduce merge conflicts**: Once `feature_1` merges, `feature_2` simply rebases onto the new main.

## Why stacked PRs?

By splitting your changes into multiple PRs, reviewers can provide faster, more targeted feedback:

1. **Shorter review cycles**: Instead of wading through 2k lines of code, teammates can review logical chunks.

2. **Easier backtracking**: If `feature_2` isn't ready, you can still move forward with `feature_1`.

3. **Iterate rapidly**: No waiting for merges to start the next piece of work.

This approach fosters a trunk-based development workflow:

- `main` stays stable.

- Short-lived branches build off `main` (or their parent branch).

- Each stacked PR merges back to `main` once approved.

## How cubic fits in

cubic automates much of the busywork typically associated with stacked branches. Instead of manually rebasing, renaming branches, or struggling with merges, you can:

- **Create branches instantly** with `mg branch <branch_name>`.

- **Visualize your stack** via `mg list`.

- **Sync** with remote changes in `main` using `mg sync`.

- **Re-parent** or rename if you need to reshape your branch relationships.

Ultimately, cubic helps teams move faster by **removing friction** from your Git workflow and letting you focus on building features, not wrangling merges.
