# mg reparent

## Name

`mg reparent` â€” Reassign the parent of a branch in the stacked hierarchy.

## Synopsis

```bash
mg reparent --parent <parent_branch> [<branch_name>]
```

## Description

- If `<branch_name>` is omitted, the current branch's parent is changed.
- Useful when a branch was based off the wrong trunk or feature.

## Options / Flags

- **`--parent <parent_branch>`**: The new parent branch.

## Examples

```bash
# Reparent your current branch to 'feature_1'
mg reparent --parent feature_1

# Reparent 'hotfix' to 'main'
mg reparent --parent main hotfix
```

## Notes / Caveats

- Re-stacking might involve rebasing. If conflicts occur, you'll need to resolve them manually.
- Use carefully if your branch was already pushed and is under active review.
