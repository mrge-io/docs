# mg create

## Name

`mg create` â€” Make a new branch on top of the current branch.

## Synopsis

```bash
mg create <branch_name> [--checkout] [--draft]
```

## Description

- Creates a new branch that is tracked within mrge's stack. By default, it does **not** switch to the new branch unless you use `--checkout`.
- The new branch is considered a child of your current branch.

## Options / Flags

- **`--checkout`**: Automatically switch to the new branch after creating it.
- **`--draft`**: Mark the branch/PR as a draft when pushing to GitHub (requires an integration that supports draft PRs).

## Examples

```bash
# Create a child branch but stay on the current branch
mg create feature/login

# Create and immediately checkout
mg create feature/ui --checkout
```

## Notes / Caveats

- If you forget to name a branch, mrge will prompt for one interactively (unless you have auto-generation turned on in `.mrgeconfig`).
- For multi-branch flows, see [Create Stacked PRs](/how-to-guides/create-stacked-prs).
