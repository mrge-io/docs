description: 'Switch to another branch tracked by cubic'

## Name

`mg checkout` â€” Switch your working directory to a different branch in the stack.

## Synopsis

```bash
mg checkout <branch_name>
```

## Description

- Changes your current working branch to `<branch_name>`.
- If `<branch_name>` isn't tracked by cubic, it will prompt you to adopt it or use normal git.

## Examples

```bash
mg checkout feature_2
```

<Note>
  - This is a thin wrapper around `git checkout` but ensures cubic tracking
  remains consistent. - If you see a "branch not tracked" error, consider [mg
  adopt](/reference/mg-adopt).
</Note>
