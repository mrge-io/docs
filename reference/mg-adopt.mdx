## Name

`mg adopt` â€” Add a previously untracked Git branch to mrge's stack.

## Synopsis

```bash
mg adopt <branch_name>
```

## Description

- If `<branch_name>` was created outside of `mg create`, adopting it integrates it into your stacked workflow.
- After adoption, it appears in `mg list`.

## Examples

```bash
# Adopt a local branch named "feature/ui-improvements"
mg adopt feature/ui-improvements
```

## Notes / Caveats

- If the parent is unclear, consider [`mg reparent`](/reference/mg-reparent).
- If the branch was orphaned before, adopting it again is effectively reintroducing it.
