description: "Bring an existing branch under cubic's management"

## Name

`mg adopt` â€” Add a previously untracked Git branch to cubic's stack.

## Synopsis

```bash
mg adopt
```

## Description

- If `<branch_name>` was created outside of `mg branch`, adopting it integrates it into your stacked workflow.
- This will open an interactive view of all of your branches that are not tracked in mg, and you can use 'space' to select branches to adopt, and enter to apply.
- After adoption, it appears in `mg list`.

## Examples

```bash
# Adopt a local branch named "feature/ui-improvements"
mg adopt feature/ui-improvements
```

<Note>
  - If the parent is unclear, consider [`mg reparent`](/reference/mg-reparent).
  - If the branch was orphaned before, adopting it again is effectively
  reintroducing it.
