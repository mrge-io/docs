# mg push

## Name

`mg push` â€” Push your branch to remote and (optionally) open or update a pull request.

## Synopsis

```bash
mg push [--all] [--draft] [--title <title>] [--body <body>]
```

## Description

- By default, pushes only the current branch.
- If no PR exists, it creates one; if a PR does exist, it updates it.
- `--all` attempts to push the entire stack from the root branch up.

## Options / Flags

- **`--all`**: Push every branch from the bottom of the stack to the top.
- **`--draft`**: Create or update the PR as a draft.
- **`--title <title>`**: Manually set the PR title.
- **`--body <body>`**: Manually set the PR description.

## Examples

```bash
# Push just the current branch
mg push

# Push all stacked branches at once
mg push --all

# Provide custom title and description
mg push --title "Awesome Feature" --body "This adds an awesome feature!"
```

## Notes / Caveats

- If you have multiple branches that haven't been pushed yet, you may need `--all`.
- You can still edit PR titles and descriptions on GitHub after pushing.
