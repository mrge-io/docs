title: "mg sync"
description: "Sync your stack with the remote trunk"
---

## Name

`mg sync` â€” Pulls the latest remote trunk (e.g., `main`), then rebases against the latest commits, and prompts you to delete and push rebased chagnes to remote.

## Synopsis

```bash
mg sync
```

## Description

- Fetches remote trunk, applies them to your current branch and all its children.
- By default, uses a rebase strategy to keep your commit history linear.

## Options / Flags

- : Use a merge strategy instead of rebase.

## Examples

```bash
# Pull main, rebase your current stack on it.
mg sync
```

<Note>
  - Conflict resolution is interactive; you must resolve conflicts before the
    sync proceeds. - If your trunk has changed drastically, consider syncing more
    frequently.
