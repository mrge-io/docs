title: 'mg sync'
description: 'Sync your stack with the remote trunk'

## Name

`mg sync` â€” Rebase or merge local branches against the latest commits from your local trunk branch (e.g., `main`).

## Synopsis

```bash
mg sync [--rebase-to-trunk][--merge]
```

## Description

* Fetches remote updates, applies them to your current branch and all its children.

* By default, uses a rebase strategy to keep your commit history linear.

## Options / Flags

* **`--rebase-to-trunk`** or `-r`: Pull origin trunk and rebase changes to that.

* **`--merge`**: Use a merge strategy instead of rebase.

## Examples

```bash
# Basic sync with default rebase approach
mg sync

# Pull origin trunk and sync your whole stack to the new trunk
mg sync -r
```

<Note>
  * Conflict resolution is interactive; you must resolve conflicts before the
    sync proceeds. - If your trunk has changed drastically, consider syncing more
    frequently.
