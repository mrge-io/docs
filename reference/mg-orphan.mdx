## Name

`mg orphan` â€” Remove a branch from cubic's stack management.

## Synopsis

```bash
mg orphan              # Orphan the current branch
mg orphan <branch_name> # Orphan a specified branch
```

## Description

- Disassociates `<branch_name>` from your cubic stack (does not delete the branch from Git).

- Child branches remain but will still point to the old parent unless reparented or orphaned as well.

## Examples

```bash
# Orphan the branch "feature_2" from the stack
mg orphan feature_2

# Orphan your the current branch you're on
mg orphan
```

<Note>
  * This is **irreversible** in cubic's metadata; to bring it back, use [mg
  adopt](/reference/mg-adopt). - Orphaned branches won't appear in `mg list`.
</Note>
