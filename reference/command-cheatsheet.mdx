This cheatsheet provides a concise reference for most mg commands. For detailed information on each command, click the command name to view its dedicated documentation page.

<Note>
  `mg` only intercepts recognized subcommands. Everything else is passed through
  to Git, so your normal Git workflow stays intact.

| [`mg branch <branch_name>`](/reference/mg-branch)         | Create a new branch on top of the one you're on (same as `create`).                    |
| [`mg list`](/reference/mg-list) (/reference/mg-list)      | View your entire stack/tree of branches.                                               |
| [`mg checkout <branch>`](/reference/mg-checkout)          | Switch to a different branch.                                                          |
| [`mg push`](/reference/mg-push)                           | Push the **current** branch (PR) to remote.                                            |

| [`mg orphan`](/reference/mg-orphan)                       | Remove the current branch from mg's tree tracking (no deletion in Git).                |
| [`mg commit -b`](/reference/mg-commit)                    | Commit **and** auto-generate a new branch name (`--branch-name <name>` if you prefer). |

| [`mg help`](/reference/mg-help)                           | See all available mg commands.                                                         |

<Warning>
  **If a PR is merged upstream**, `mg sync` automatically re-stacks child
  branches to the new parent. This doesn't directly pull from `main`â€”so if you
  want local changes from the remote trunk, run `mg sync` or do a `git pull`.
</Warning>

## Common Workflows

### Creating a stack

```bash
mg create feature_1
# Make changes
mg add . && mg commit -m "Feature 1 changes"
mg create feature_2
# Make more changes
mg add . && mg commit -m "Feature 2 changes"
mg push --all
```

### Keeping a stack updated

```bash
# When main has changed
mg sync
```

### Moving between branches in a stack

```bash
# Move to parent branch
mg prev

# Move to child branch
mg next
```
