# mg prev

## Name

`mg prev` â€” Switch to the "previous" parent branch in your current stack.

## Synopsis

```bash
mg prev
```

## Description

- Lets you move upwards in your stack. For instance, from `feature_2` back to `feature_1`.

## Examples

```bash
# Move from feature_2 to feature_1
mg prev
```

## Notes / Caveats

- If you're already on the root branch (e.g., `main`), `mg prev` does nothing.
- In a multi-parent scenario, mrge will pick the direct parent listed for your branch.
