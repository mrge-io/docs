## Name

`mg list` — List all branches in a tree-like hierarchy, reflecting parent-child relationships.

## Synopsis

```bash
mg list [--all]
```

## Description

- Lists a concise tree of all branches managed by cubic, starting from the trunk branch.
- Useful for large projects with multiple layers of stacked branches.

## Options / Flags

- **`--all`**: Include orphaned or merged branches in the tree.

## Examples

```bash
mg list
# output:
# main
# └── feature_1
#     └── feature_2

# Show orphaned branches as well
mg list --all
```

<Note>
  - If a branch is not recognized by cubic, it won't appear unless adopted (see
  [mg adopt](/reference/mg-adopt)). - The tree reflects local config; ensure
  you've synced with remote to see up-to-date info.
</Note>
