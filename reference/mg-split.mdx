# mg split

## Name

`mg split` â€” Rewrite Git history by splitting or folding commits.

## Synopsis

```bash
mg split <commit_sha> [--fold]
```

## Description

- Opens an interactive interface to let you choose how to break large commits into smaller ones.
- With `--fold`, merges multiple commits into one.

## Options / Flags

- **`--fold`**: Instead of splitting, fold consecutive commits into a single commit.

## Examples

```bash
# Split a large commit
mg split abc123

# Fold commits interactively
mg split abc123 --fold
```

## Notes / Caveats

- Rewrites history; child branches may need to rebase if they depend on the modified commits.
- Use caution with previously pushed commits, as force pushes might be required.
