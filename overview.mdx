**mrge** is a developer-centric platform that helps you manage **stacked pull requests** more efficiently. With our lightweight CLI, **`mg`**, you can split large features into smaller, logically independent branches, making reviews faster and merges less error-prone.

---

## Why use stacked PRs?

- **Smaller diffs**: Each branch focuses on one piece of the feature, so your teammates can review it more quickly.
- **Continuous progress**: Keep building on subsequent branches even if earlier PRs haven't merged yet.
- **Easier merges**: Conflicts are confined to smaller sets of changes, and `mg` can automatically re-stack child branches if the trunk updates.

## How mrge helps

- **Simple commands**: Create, push, and visualize stacked branches with minimal effort.
- **Works with your GitHub workflow**: Two-way sync ensures you can merge in GitHub or in mrge's UIâ€”whichever you prefer.
- **CLI pass-through**: Any command `mg` doesn't recognize is forwarded to `git`, so there's no disruption to your existing workflow.
