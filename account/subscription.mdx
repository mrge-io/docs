---

Your mrge subscription cost is determined by the number of developer seats you choose to activate. Each active seat corresponds to a unique GitHub user within your organization.

- **Seat-based billing:** You are billed based on the number of _active_ seats you assign to your team members (GitHub users).
- **Flexible seat management:** You can manage seat assignments at any time, both during your free trial and after it ends.
- **Customizable checkout:** When you purchase a subscription, you select the exact number of seats you need.
- **Subscription management:** Seat assignments and active seats can be viewed and managed through the subscription tab in your settings: [https://www.mrge.io/settings?tab=subscription](https://www.mrge.io/settings?tab=subscription)

### Automatic seat assignment for new developers

You can choose to automatically assign seats to new developers who join your linked GitHub organization. This setting can be toggled in your subscription settings.

When enabled, any new developer joining your GitHub organization will automatically be assigned a mrge seat and included in your billing. Conversely, if a developer leaves your organization, their seat will be automatically removed, and you will no longer be billed for them.

- **Compatibility with manual selection:** This feature works alongside manual seat selection. For example, if you have manually assigned seats to 3 out of 10 developers in your organization and then enable the "Assign seats to new developers" toggle, when an 11th developer joins the organization, they will automatically receive a mrge seat, bringing your total assigned seats to 4.

## Free trial

During the free trial period, you can assign as many developer seats as you like to evaluate mrge with your team. Billing will only begin after the trial ends and is based on the number of seats you select at checkout.
