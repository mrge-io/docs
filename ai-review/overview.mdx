# Catch bugs before they reach production

mrge’s AI reviewer delivers actionable feedback seconds after you open a pull request so your team can:

- **Ship faster** – shorten review‑to‑merge time by up to 30 percent
- **Prevent incidents** – surface logic errors and regressions before they are merged
- **Focus on features** – let the bot handle style nits and repetitive checks

[Enable mrge on your repository](/ai-review/setup)

## Why modern teams choose mrge

- **Prevents production incidents** – surfaces regressions and edge-case failures before they reach customers, reducing outages and post-mortems.
- **Context-aware analysis** – examines your entire codebase and past merges to avoid noisy, one-size-fits-all warnings.
- **Actionable diff suggestions** – inline fixes you can apply with a single click.
- **Learns from your feedback** – replies or approvals adapt future reviews for the whole team.
- **Works out of the box** – zero configuration required; extend later with custom rules.

  mrge runs in an isolated container and never stores source code. See our{' '}

## Key features

1. **Automated code reviews**

   - Scans pull requests for logic errors, style inconsistencies and potential vulnerabilities.
   - Adds structured comments and suggestions directly in the pull request.

2. **Codebase awareness**

   - Detects the libraries and frameworks in your repository, including version numbers.
   - References existing patterns or utilities when proposing improvements.

3. **Custom rules**

   - Enforce domain‑specific guidelines or internal best practices.
   - Violations are flagged automatically based on your configured rules.

4. **Adaptive feedback**

   - Learns from previous merges, review comments and dismissals.
   - Reduces false positives over time and tailors advice to your codebase.
