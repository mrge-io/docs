**mrge**'s AI reviewer helps software teams ship code faster by providing immediate, actionable feedback on pull requests.

It learns your repository context, coding patterns, and adapts based on your feedback to deliver more accurate reviews.

## Key features

1. **Automated code reviews**

   - Scans pull requests for logic errors, style inconsistencies, and potential vulnerabilities.
   - Leaves structured comments and suggestions directly in the PR.

2. **Codebase awareness**

   - Detects libraries and frameworks in your repo (including their versions).
   - References relevant code patterns or utilities found in your codebase when suggesting improvements.

3. **Custom rules**

   - Enforce specialized guidelines, such as domain-specific standards or internal best practices.
   - Automatically flags violations based on your configured rules.

4. **Adaptive feedback**

   - Learns from your team's past merges, comments, and preferences.
   - Improves over time to reduce false positives and tailor advice to your codebase.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable AI review">
    Enable AI review for your repository in the AI review page.
    <img src="/ai-review/images/ai-review-page.png" alt="Enable AI review"  className="border border-zinc-800 rounded-lg"/>
  </Step>

    <Step title="Open a pull request">
    Once a new PR is created, mrge scans the changed files and runs its analysis.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Automated review">
    The AI leaves comments regarding potential issues or recommended improvements.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Custom rules check">
    If you have custom rules in place, the AI will also flag any violations based
    on those criteria.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Feedback and collaboration">
    If a comment needs clarification or correction, you can reply to the AI
    comment to refine its behavior for future reviews.
    </Step>

  <Step title="Merge or iterate">
    Address, ignore, or further discuss the flagged items. When ready, merge the PR.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Currently, mrge analyzes the code once per pull request creation. If you
  commit additional changes, the AI will not automatically re-check those (this
  feature is planned for a future release).
</Note>

## Manually triggering AI reviews

You can manually trigger an AI review at any time:

- Click the "Run AI review" button located in the dropdown menu at the top of your PR view.
- Alternatively, press the circular arrow icon on the right side of the PR interface.

This allows you to run the AI review again after making additional commits or changes.
