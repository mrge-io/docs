**mrge's AI code reviewer** automatically evaluates each _new pull request_ against **custom rules** that you define. Think of these rules as **natural-language linting**—they outline what your code should (or shouldn't) do, and the AI flags any relevant concerns.

> **Note**: Currently, the AI code reviewer **only runs once** per PR creation. If more commits are pushed to the same PR, an additional review is not triggered.  
> **Future Plans**: we're working on support for re-checking whenever new commits are pushed.

## Key benefits

- **Immediate feedback**: When a pull request is opened, the AI analyzes the changed files and posts warnings or comments as needed.
- **Customizable**: You can define your own rules—e.g., "Wrap all API calls with Sentry error tracking" or "Disallow N+1 queries in database access"—to enforce team standards.
- **Lightweight & minimal disruption**: The review shows up like any other automated check. You can merge or fix the code just as you normally would.

## Workflow summary

1. **Create a pull request**: The AI reviewer is automatically triggered on the changed files.
2. **AI generates suggestions**: If a rule is violated, the PR receives comments or warnings. Sometimes, the AI can even suggest fixes if you prompt it in the review discussion.
3. **Developer reviews & fixes**: You decide whether to address the flagged items or ignore them.
4. **Merge or iterate**: Once you're satisfied, merge the PR or continue making changes (knowing the AI won't re-run on those new commits—yet).
