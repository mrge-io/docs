title: 'AI review settings'

Within your project's [settings](https://cubic.io/settings), the **AI review** section offers controls to tailor the reviewer's behavior.

## Configurable options

<Note>
  AI review settings are configured at the repository level, allowing you to
  have different configuration options for different repositories.
</Note>

1. **Review instructions**

   - Provide general guidelines for the AI in plaintext.

2. **Library & framework versions**

   - Specify or override detected versions (e.g., React 18, Django 4) to improve suggestion accuracy.
   - Note that by default cubic will try to automatically detect the common libraries and versions they use to ensure that it tailors its reviews to those specific ones.

3. **Ignore patterns**

   - Define files or directories (using regex or glob) that the AI should not analyze (e.g., `dist/`, `docs/`).

4. **Exclude generated files**

   For large repositories, you can tell cubic to ignore files that don't require review. This is handy for:

   - Data files that don’t need to be reviewed
   - Auto‑generated code produced by build or code‑gen tools
   - Any other files that would make a pull request too large for cubic to process

   You can do this by marking files as generated in your repository’s `.gitattributes` file:

   ```gitattributes
   # Exclude specific files
   docs/data.txt linguist-generated=true

   # Exclude file types
   *.csv linguist-generated=true
   *.pb.go linguist-generated=true

   # Exclude entire directories
   data/* linguist-generated=true
   generated/* linguist-generated=true
   ```

   Files marked as `linguist-generated` will be:

   - Automatically collapsed in GitHub pull request views
   - Skipped entirely during **cubic**'s code review

## Next steps

- [Providing feedback](/ai-review/feedback): Refine the AI's suggestions directly within PR comments.
- [Custom rules](/ai-review/custom-rules): Create domain-specific checks to expand beyond general analysis.
