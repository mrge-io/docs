title: 'AI review settings'

Within your project's [settings](https://mrge.io/settings), the **AI review** section offers controls to tailor the reviewer's behavior.

## Configurable options

<Note>
  AI review settings are configured at the repository level, allowing you to
  have different configuration options for different repositories.
</Note>

1. **Review instructions**

   - Provide general guidelines for the AI in plaintext.

2. **Library & framework versions**

   - Specify or override detected versions (e.g., React 18, Django 4) to improve suggestion accuracy.
   - Note that by default mrge will try to automatically detect the common libraries and versions they use to ensure that it tailors its reviews to those specific ones.

3. **Ignore patterns**

   - Define files or directories (using regex or glob) that the AI should not analyze (e.g., `dist/`, `docs/`).

4. **Draft PRs**

   - Enable or disable AI reviews for draft pull requests.

5. **Memory management**

   - Review or modify stored feedback.
   - Delete entries if they are no longer applicable.

## Next steps

- [Providing feedback](/ai-review/feedback): Refine the AI's suggestions directly within PR comments.
- [Custom rules](/ai-review/custom-rules): Create domain-specific checks to expand beyond general analysis.
